# Mr.Dev_s

The easiest way to start creating with Mr.Dev.'s Framework!

Mr.Dev. grabbed Underscores, the famous starter theme for Wordpress, and made it fully compatible with each and every feature of his Framework.

**Mr.Dev.'s Framework**

Being fully compatible with the framework is not mandatory. But this theme is because it brings the following:

- 20 colors. Because this theme is inspired by Underscores, the default color values are the colors of Underscores website.

- 2 fonts. Being a starter theme it was decided to use system fonts by default: "Times New Roman" for headings and "Arial" for other text _(but this might change in the future)_-

- 16 preset sizes. You can check all the defaults on _mrdev-framework/vars/styles.php_. *(Also there you can find a comment showing how to add breakpoints from the theme)*

(and to come:)

- 4 sections when using Layout Control: Header Top, Main Content Top, Main Content Bottom and Footer Bottom.

- Compatibility with every display option.

**Some key differences vs Underscores:**

- No default widgets and no forced logo or menu in the header - This is to better follow the new workflow on Wordpress _(using blocks and reusable blocks per page instead of widgets)_ and to prepare for the full site editor. You can still create new sidebars/sections using "layout control" on Mr.Dev.'s Framework.
- Auto dropdown menu - With _Mr.Dev_s_ any default menu widget located inside ".mr-header" will automatically become a structured dropdown menu.
- Removed customizer additions - Most of those additions were not needed: They would force the website to show the sitename on a specific place or are better kept to plugins such as Mr.Dev.'s Framework.
- Removed forced image sizes on Woocommerce - Removed the default sizes of 150 and 300 for product images because those can be set using the Customizer. All other compatibility with Woocommerce and Jetpack was kept in this theme.
